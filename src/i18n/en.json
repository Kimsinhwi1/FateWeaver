        "title": "What is Saju? The Korean Birth Chart Reading Explained",
        "summary": "Discover the ancient Korean art of Saju reading — how your birth date and time reveal your destiny through the Four Pillars.",
        "ogDescription": "Learn about Saju, the Korean fortune telling system based on the Four Pillars of Destiny. Understand how your birth chart shapes your life path.",
        "body": [
          "Saju (四柱), meaning 'Four Pillars,' is one of Korea's oldest and most respected fortune telling traditions. While Western astrology looks to the stars, Saju reading examines the cosmic energy present at the exact moment of your birth — your year, month, day, and hour — each forming a pillar of your destiny.",
          "Each pillar is composed of two characters: a Heavenly Stem and an Earthly Branch. Together, the eight characters (known as 'Saju Palja' or Eight Characters) create a unique cosmic fingerprint. This birth chart reveals your core personality, natural talents, life challenges, and the flow of fortune throughout your life.",
          "At the heart of every Saju reading lies the Five Elements: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. These elements interact through cycles of creation and control. Wood feeds Fire, Fire creates Earth (ash), Earth yields Metal, Metal collects Water, and Water nourishes Wood. When your elements are balanced, life flows smoothly. When they are not, a skilled reader can identify which element you need more of.",
          "Your Day Master — the Heavenly Stem of your day pillar — represents your true self. It determines how you think, relate to others, and navigate challenges. For example, a Wood Day Master person is like a growing tree: flexible, ambitious, and always reaching upward. A Metal Day Master is like a refined blade: decisive, principled, and sharp.",
          "What makes Saju unique compared to other fortune telling systems is its emphasis on timing. The Four Pillars don't just describe who you are — they map out 10-year periods of fortune called 'Daeun,' showing when opportunities will arise and when patience is needed.",
          "Modern Saju reading has evolved beyond traditional consultations. At FateWeaver, we combine Saju analysis with Western Tarot and AI interpretation, creating a fusion reading that bridges Eastern and Western wisdom traditions."

        "title": "Free AI Tarot Reading: How It Works and Why It's Different",
        "summary": "Get a free AI tarot reading that combines traditional card symbolism with personalized birth chart analysis — powered by advanced AI.",
        "ogDescription": "Try our free AI tarot reading. Unlike generic online tarot, FateWeaver combines your birth chart with card symbolism for a deeply personal reading.",
        "body": [
          "Online tarot readings have come a long way from random card generators. With advances in AI, it's now possible to receive a tarot reading that feels genuinely personal — one that considers not just the cards you draw, but who you are at a fundamental level.",
          "FateWeaver's free AI tarot reading works in three steps. First, you enter your birth date (and optionally, your birth time). Our system calculates your Saju — the Korean birth chart based on the Four Pillars of Destiny. This reveals your elemental balance, core personality, and current life phase.",
          "Next, three tarot cards are drawn for your Past, Present, and Future positions. Each card carries rich symbolism — The Empress speaks of nurturing abundance, The Tower signals sudden transformation, The Star promises hope after darkness. But here's what makes our reading different: we don't just tell you what each card means.",
          "In the final step, our AI Oracle weaves your birth chart data together with the tarot card symbolism. If your Saju shows a strong Water element and you draw The Star, the reading might speak of deep intuitive wisdom guiding you through a period of renewal. If your Day Master is Metal and you draw The Tower, it could reveal how your natural decisiveness will help you navigate an unexpected change.",
          "This fusion approach means no two readings are alike, even if the same cards appear. Your unique cosmic blueprint ensures the interpretation speaks directly to your life situation. The AI has been trained in both Eastern Saju philosophy and Western Tarot traditions, allowing it to find connections that would take a human reader years of dual study.",
          "The best part? Your first reading is completely free. No account required, no credit card needed. Just your birth date and an open mind."

        "summary": "Find your Saju Archetype — a fusion of Korean birth chart wisdom and Jungian psychology that reveals your deepest personality patterns.",
        "ogDescription": "Discover your Saju Archetype based on Korean astrology and Jungian psychology. Find out if you're The Magician, The Sage, or one of 12 archetypes.",
        "body": [
          "What if your Korean birth chart could reveal not just your fortune, but your fundamental personality archetype? By combining the ancient wisdom of Saju with Carl Jung's theory of archetypes, we've created something entirely new: the Saju Archetype system.",
          "Jung identified universal patterns in the human psyche — The Hero, The Sage, The Magician, The Explorer, and more. These archetypes appear across every culture and era because they represent fundamental ways of being human. Your Saju birth chart, with its unique balance of Five Elements, naturally aligns with specific archetypes.",
          "Here's how it works: Your Day Master (the element representing your core self) determines your primary archetype category. A Fire Day Master naturally gravitates toward passionate, transformative archetypes like The Magician or The Creator. A Water Day Master resonates with deep, intuitive types like The Sage or The Mystic.",
          "But your archetype isn't determined by your Day Master alone. The balance of all Five Elements in your birth chart refines the result. Someone with a Fire Day Master but strong Water influence might be The Sage — passionate about knowledge and truth. The same Fire Day Master with dominant Wood energy could be The Hero — driven by growth and courageous action.",
          "Your favorable element (the energy your chart needs most) reveals your secondary archetype — the qualities you're developing throughout your life. This creates a rich, nuanced personality portrait that goes far beyond simple sun sign astrology.",
          "The twelve Saju Archetypes are: The Ruler (leadership and responsibility), The Sage (wisdom and truth), The Explorer (freedom and discovery), The Innocent (optimism and trust), The Creator (imagination and expression), The Hero (courage and mastery), The Magician (transformation and vision), The Rebel (liberation and revolution), The Lover (passion and connection), The Caregiver (generosity and compassion), The Jester (joy and presence), and The Everyman (belonging and authenticity).",
          "Unlike personality tests that rely on self-reported answers, your Saju Archetype is calculated from objective data — the cosmic conditions at your birth. Many people find it reveals patterns they've always sensed but could never quite name."
